# U.S. West Coast fisheries landings data

This is my GitHub repository for cleaning U.S. West Coast fisheries landings data.

It also contains all of the data, code, tables, and figures for the following paper:

* Free CM, Vargas Poulsen C, Bellquist LF, Wassermann SN, Oken KL. The CALFISH database: a century of Californiaâ€™s non-confidential fisheries landings and participation data. In first revision at Ecological Informatics.

Please email Chris Free (cfree14@gmail.com) with any questions.

Note to self: you moved these folders from another repository so many of the paths will be broken. Update them as you use them.
